# Promise Practice 2

This is another simple promise practice.

You are to utilize the Rick and Morty Character API at 'https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character' to fetch the information from.

The user should open to a blank page. When they click on the page (ANYWHERE ON THE PAGE!) it should reveal a character from the show Rick and Morty.

It should display their status (Alive, Dead, or Unknown) at the top of the page, then their name, a photo of them, and their species.

It should randomly generate a character (using a randomly generated integer) on each click.

If the character is Alive the background color should become green, if they are dead, read, and if unknown it should be white.

All of this should be implemented in the div with id "content".

Some sample photos of my solution are provided for additional guidance if needed.

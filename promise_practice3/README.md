# README

Make a webpage that generates movie times based on the fake api given.

Your fetch should generate a drop down selection of all available days and movies given by the api.

Once the dropdown is generated, the user should be able to select a day or movie and have the movie's information and the movie's times for that day available on the screen. An example of the expected end result is given in the png.

You can have the information load when the webpage loads OR once a selection is made for either the day or the movie.
